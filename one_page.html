    <p>That dude,<br /> <b>Mickey</b>, <br /> he really loves broccolis.</p>

    <h1> A new story </h1>
    <p> This has <i>nothing</i> to do with Mickey and his broccoli obsession.</p>
    <h2>An unlikely friend</h2>
    <p>Mickey met Goofy in a dumpster. He wrote a poem:</p>
    <p><blockquote>Oh Goofy<br />Why are you eating garbage<br /><em>again</em>?</blockquote></p>
    <p>Well, the point was, Goofy was <strong>not</strong> ashamed. He had once said: <q>Garbage is beautiful.</q></p>
    <p>Goofy was, in fact, a proud member of <abbr title="Garbage Eaters Associated">GEA</abbr>. He had even written a book about it: <cite>Why We Should All Eat Garbage</cite>. In some circles, he was known as a <dfn>garbagist</dfn>, a fine connoisseur of <del>inedible</del> <ins>the most delicious</ins> trash.</p>
    <p>Mickey was disappointed because:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Goofy stank;</li>
      <li>he was hoping to find some broccolis in the dumpster.</li>
    </ol>

    />
    <p>According to Goofy, there were three kinds of garbage:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Tasty</dt>
      <dd>The trash that you want to eat.</dd>
      <dt>Nutritious</dt>
      <dd>The trash that you need to eat.</dd>
      <dt>Taken</dt>
      <dt>No longer available</dt>
      <dd>The trash that you have already eaten.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>"You should really check out this website," said Goofy. "It's <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dsny/site/services/waste-page" target="_blank">pretty dope</a>. Also, feel free to <a href="mailto:goofy@garbageeaters.gea">keep in touch by email</a>." He then left, headed towards a <a href="page_two.html">mysterious destination.</a></p>
